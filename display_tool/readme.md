# Was is the display_tool üí°

This repository was created to help analysis the results of a benchmark between different algorithms dealing with images. Imagine you have 200
images in the folder `inputs/` and you want to compare the outputs that different models, let's say `algo1`, `algo2`... `algoN` give when ran on
all images of `inputs/`. If you store the outputs of the N algorithms in N folders, the **display_tool** will create some PDFs that contain on each
page one of the input images and the corresponding outputs of the different algorithmes. <br> <br>

Along with the stripes created, made of the input and the outputs of each algorithm, you can get a zoom in each image to have more details. This is
done thanks the `--zoom *zooming_option* ` argument that is per default set to *center*. What means that it will plot just bellow each image a center
crop of the images. <br> <br>

Here comes an illustration of the overall operating of **display_tool** : <br><br>

# How to use display_tool üìù

First of all you should get the input and outputs folders at the same location in the same folder, to have something like this : <br><br>

Then you can call the display_tool.py file from the command line :

`python display_tool.py --inputs_folder *path/to/folder/with/inputs* --output_pdf_path *where/you/want/the/pdf/written* --zoom *"center"* ` </br></br>

<ins>Note</ins> : For the moment the only zoom option is center, but other options will soon be available.
